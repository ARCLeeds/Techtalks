# Agenda

<p style="text-align:left;">
Today we're going to touch on ways to make our code reproducible.
</p>

- __Basics__ \- version control and project management
- __Conda__ \- to record environments and manage packages
- __Virtual Machines__ \- using vagrant to script virtual machine configuration
- __Containers__ \- a small, portable approach to sharing environments
- __Workflow tools__ \- e.g. Snakemake, Luigi
- __Notebooks__ \- The computational scientists lab book

# Basic building blocks

<p style="text-align:left;">
The basic building blocks of a good, reproducible project are:
</p>

- version control e.g. git
- Simple project management structure

## Version control

<p style="text-align:left;">
Version control or source control systems are means by which we can track changes in our code. 
</p>

- It keeps a clear and accountable linear timeline of changes
- Very useful when coding in a team
- Prevents folders filling up with <br> `draft1.txt draft1.2.txt draft.1.2.3.txt`
- We encourage people to use [`git`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)


## Project management

<p style="text-align:left;">
Keeping all files relating to a project in a single folder is a good starting point.
</p>

```
project_name/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # overview of the project
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                 # data files used in the project
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # describes where data came from
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sub-folder/       # may contain subdirectories
â”œâ”€â”€ processed_data/       # intermediate files from the analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ manuscript/           # manuscript describing the results
â”œâ”€â”€ results/              # results of the analysis (data, tables, figures)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # contains all code in the project
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE           # license for your code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt  # software requirements and dependencies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ doc/                  # documentation for your project
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.rst
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

<figcaption>
[Cookie cutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) and [RStudio projects](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro/) are a good entry point for this.

# Conda

<p style="text-align:left;">
The code we write often depends on other code. Tools such as conda try to help isolate 
specific dependencies:
</p>

- Install packages with specific versions
- Record those versions
- Isolate environments with distinct packages
- Using different R/Python versions per project
- Provides tools for sharing environments and packages

## Conda illustrated

# Virtual machines and Vagrant

- Virtual machines allow us to run an alternate operating system on our host machine.
- They require some set up, but can be super useful
- Vagrant is a tool that can help!

## Vagrantfile

- We write a Vagrant recipe file that allows anyone to replicate the exact operating system environment used to run your code

```

                        Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
                            config.vm.box = "hashicorp/bionic64"
                        end


```

- We did a TechTalk earlier this year that showcases [Vagrant with examples](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/Techtalks/techtalk-vagrant/#/title-slide)

# Containers

## What are containers?

- Containers let you bundle up __all__ the ingredients into a single package that you can run
- This means you don't need a virtual machine and makes them very portable
- They have drawbacks but can be a powerful tool for sharing code/results

# Workflow tools

## Capturing our workflow takes many forms

## Just remembering where we clicked

<img src="images/keyboard.gif" data-lazy-loaded="" style="width: 60%;">

## Use Bash or GNU Make

<img src="images/magic.gif" data-lazy-loaded="" style="width: 60%;">

## Use workflow tools like Snakemake/Luigi

<img src="images/luigi.gif" data-lazy-loaded="" style="width: 50%;">

## Snakemake and Luigi are workflow managers

## Snakemake concepts

- Snakemake is easy to learn
- Available on all platforms and HPC compatibleðŸŽ‰
- Workflows can scale from laptop to cluster

# Notebooks

## Jupyter

- JupyterLab is an interactive development environment
- It lets you code, write notes, include graphics
- You can run it in Python, R, Julia and many [others](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)

## Reproducify your notebooks

<img src="images/freshprince.gif" data-lazy-loaded="" style="width: 60%;">

## 

- [BinderHub](https://mybinder.org/), is a service that lets you run your notebooks on the web
- [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), a google service that provides a notebook like environment for writing code and easy access to GPUs
- [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), a package that can turn your notebooks into pdfs or interactive books
